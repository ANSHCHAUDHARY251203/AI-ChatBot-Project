# AI-ChatBot-Project
This project implements a basic AI chatbot functionality that automates email notifications for room booking requests using Python. The chatbot collects user input such as phone number, booking date, and time, then constructs and sends a structured email to a designated recipient via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) using Gmail's SMTP server.
